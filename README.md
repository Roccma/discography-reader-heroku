# Discography Reader

This is a project developed in Angular. It is able to read a .txt file with the data about Bob Dylan's dicography (released year and disk's name).

The application orders the data and classifies it according the decade where the disks was released. Then, it connects with the Trello API and generate a list for each decade and put the cards in the correct column. In the case where two disks have the same year, then the order will be alphabetically.

Other feature, is the connection with Spotify to get the art clip for each disk!
